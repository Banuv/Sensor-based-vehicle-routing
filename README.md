# Sensor-based-vehicle-routing
A Concept for a Pedestrian-Dependent and Sensor-Based Vehicle Routing


Introduction

The transition between modes of transport is often challenging aspect. For
example, changing from a train to bus or vice versa along with the luggage.
Hence the project ADAMO - Ganzheitliches adaptives Interaktionssystem
für die intermodale Mobilität provides a better mobility solution for this
transition. It aims to particularly support people with physical disabilities to
ease their transition. The project contains miniaturized vehicles to help with
this transition. For effective support there is communication and interaction
with other vehicles (trains, buses, etc.) and the infrastructure (stops, lifts,
etc.). Furthermore, a self-learning, adaptive control and a modular sensor
framework is to be designed, thus enabling partially and fully autonomous
driving in conflicting traffic areas. In addition, an user friendly interface is
to created.

Motivation:
  I will be focusing on conceptualizing a Pedestrian-Dependent
and Sensor-Based Vehicle Routing, which will help the vehicle to take the
optimal path to reach the destination. The optimal path having less pedestrian
density, being faster and collision free.

Project Objectives:
We have to ensure intelligent, safe and efficient transportation of the miniaturized
vehicle from the origin to the destination. The following are the
objectives of the project:
• The vehicles has to be equipped with a both visual and non-visual
sensors, the initial goal is identifying the suitable sensor to monitor
the pedestrian traffic density.
• Merge the real-time and historic sensor data obtained to create a map
consisting of all the feasible path for the vehicle to proceed with.
• Simultaneously, these Miniaturized vehicles must not hinder other passengers
or passers-by under any circumstances, hence a dynamic collision
avoidance is an integral part of the control system.
